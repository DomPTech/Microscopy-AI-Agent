Please run the following experiment on the real microscope (use real servers):
The AS server is already running, no need to start it. Only start CEOs and Central.

1) Calibrate screen current.
2) For the following beam current values (pA): [10, 30, 50, 80, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000] (just do the first four)
   - Set the beam current on AS using `set_beam_current`.
   - Re-focus using `tune_C1A1`.
   - Acquire the tableau from Ceos with these arguments: {'tabType':"Fast", 'angle':18}.
   - To get the aberrations from the tableau (which is a dictionary):
      - get ['results']['aberrations'].
   - Compute the probe from the returned aberrations and store results in a list.
   - Break after the first iteration for a quick test run.
3) Capture one image from AS (size 512) and save it.

Return a short summary of actions and any saved file paths.
